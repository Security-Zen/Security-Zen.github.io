		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Connect Options</p>
                 <p class="szt">"Security Protocol" may be set to use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2.<br/>Note that Salesforce required the change to TLS 1.2 back in 2019</p>
		 <p class="szt">"ANT Package API Version" is the API version used while creating an ANT package.  This determines what Entity Types are available.  Set to a specific API version or set to 0 to automatically determine the API version based on the highest API version specified for Apex Classes in the connected environment.</p>
                 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Retrieve Options</p>
                 <p class="szt">"Retrieve Max Number of Polls" is the maximum number of times that the server will be contacted to determine retrieve status.</p>
                 <p class="szt">"Retrieve Poll Time (seconds)" is the amount of time to wait between Polls during a retrieve.</p>
	         <p class="szt">Note: For larger data sets, the above numbers may need to be increased.</p>
	         <p class="szt">"Load System Permissions" determines whether System Permissions should be added to the workspace when a retrieve is performed.  Available Options:</p>
	         <ul>
		      <li class="szt">Prompt: User is prompted each time to either load System Permissions or not.</li>
		      <li class="szt">Always: System Permissions are always loaded without prompting the user.</li>
		      <li class="szt">Never: System Permissions are never loaded and user is not prompted.</li>
	         </ul>
	         <p class="szt">"Permission Set Entities Retrieved" determines what entities are retrieved when a Permission Set is specified.  Available Options:</p>
	         <ul>
		      <li class="szt">As Specified: Only entities specified in the Configure window are retrieved</li>
		      <li class="szt">As Specified and All Entities Granted Permissions: Entities specified in the Configure window as well as all entities granted permissions in the Permission Set are retrieved.  When using this option, be advised that for entities not specified in the Configure window, only the Permission Set security is retrieved.  If a mixture of Profiles and Permission Sets is specified, the Profile security will only include entities specified in the Configure window.</li>
	         </ul>

		 <p class="szh2"><a class="szhlink" href="/doc/sfactions">SF Actions</a></p>
                 <p class="szt">Once you have made selections within Configure, select SF Actions->Retrieve to get the security settings from the Connection.  Watch the grid populate and get a whole new view of your security!</p>
                 <p class="szt">You can also deploy to other environments using SF Actions->Deploy, view details of previous deployments using SF Actions->View Deploy Details or analyze how security is assigned to users using SF Actions->Security Assignment Analysis.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2"><a class="szhlink" href="/doc/workspaceactions">Workspace Actions</a></p>
                 <p class="szt">This is where the fun really starts!</p>
                 <p class="szt">You can sort, show/hide and much more to help you make sense of it all.  You can make changes directly in the workspace or highlight multiple cells and right click for even more options.  Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V are supported to easily copy and paste multiple cells.</p>
                 <p class="szt">Alternatively, export to a CSV file for further analysis and then import changes back into Security Zen.</p>
		 <p class="szt">Once you are happy with your changes, go back to SF Actions and select Deploy. Changes will be deployed to whatever is the current Connection. This gives you the flexibility to deploy your changes to the environment you retrieved security from or change connections and deploy to another environment.</p>
