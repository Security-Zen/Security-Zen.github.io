		 <p class="szt">Options let you fine tune Security Zen to work best for you.  Options will automatically be saved upon closing the window.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Connect Options</p>
                 <p class="szt">"Security Protocol" may be set to use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2.<br/>Note that Salesforce required the change to TLS 1.2 back in 2019</p>
		 <p class="szt">"ANT Package API Version" is the API version used while creating an ANT package.  This determines what Entity Types are available.  Set to a specific API version or set to 0 to automatically determine the API version based on the highest API version specified for Apex Classes in the connected environment.</p>
                 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Retrieve Options</p>
                 <p class="szt">"Retrieve Max Number of Polls" is the maximum number of times that the server will be contacted to determine retrieve status.</p>
                 <p class="szt">"Retrieve Poll Time (seconds)" is the amount of time to wait between Polls during a retrieve.</p>
	         <p class="szt">Note: For larger data sets, the above numbers may need to be increased.</p>
	         <p class="szt szm0">"Load System Permissions" determines whether System Permissions should be added to the workspace when a retrieve is performed.  Available Options:</p>
	         <ul class="szm0">
		      <li class="szt">Prompt: User is prompted each time to either load System Permissions or not.</li>
		      <li class="szt">Always: System Permissions are always loaded without prompting the user.</li>
		      <li class="szt">Never: System Permissions are never loaded and user is not prompted.</li>
	         </ul>
		 <p></p>
	         <p class="szt szm0">"Permission Set Entities Retrieved" determines what entities are retrieved when a Permission Set is specified.  Available Options:</p>
	         <ul  class="szm0">
		      <li class="szt">As Specified: Only entities specified in the Configure window are retrieved</li>
		      <li class="szt">As Specified and All Entities Granted Permissions: Entities specified in the Configure window as well as all entities granted permissions in the Permission Set are retrieved.  When using this option, be advised that for entities not specified in the Configure window, only the Permission Set security is retrieved.  If a mixture of Profiles and Permission Sets is specified, the Profile security will only include entities specified in the Configure window.</li>
	         </ul>
		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Display Options</p>
                 <p class="szt szm0"">"Color Scheme" determines the colors assigned to cells based on permissions.  Available Options:</p>
                 <ul  class="szm0">
		      <li class="szt">Red Yellow Green (stop light color scheme):</li>
		      <ul>
		         <li class="szt">Red = no access</li>
		         <li class="szt">Yellow = some access</li>
		         <li class="szt">Green = full access</li>
		      </ul>
		      <li class="szt">Red Yellow Blue (high contrast color scheme):</li>
		      <ul>
		         <li class="szt">Red = no access</li>
		         <li class="szt">Yellow = some access</li>
		         <li class="szt">Blue = full access</li>
		      </ul>
	         </ul>
                 <p class="szt">"Header Rotation" determines the rotation of column headers.  0 degrees is horizontal.  90 degrees is vertical.  A range of 70-85 degrees seems to provide a good balance of readability and data density.</p>
	         <p class="szt">"Font Size" determines the font size within the workspace.  Valid values are from 1 to 96, but more realistic values are usually between 6 and 12.  Default is 8.</p>
		 <p class="szt">Note that large font sizes may cause the column headers to take up the entire height of the screen which makes the scroll bars disappear.  Don't panic!  To correct this, either use a smaller font size or go to the bottom of the headers and resize the height of the headers to be smaller.</p>
		 <p class="szt">"Column Width" determines the column width in Pixels.  Default value is 70.  Specifying a Column Width of 0 enables Automatic Column Width which is based on the width of the Column Header.  Automatic Column Width is recommended in conjunction with a "Header Rotation" of 70-85 degrees.</p>
		 <p class="szt">"Sort Rows" will cause the rows to be sorted upon retrieval.  Version 3.1 has significantly improved this function and is now recommended to be checked.</p>
		 <p class="szt">"Active Users Only" determines whether all users, or just active users, are included in user queries.  This affects the following features:</p>

                 <p class="szt">This is where the fun really starts!</p>
                 <p class="szt">You can sort, show/hide and much more to help you make sense of it all.  You can make changes directly in the workspace or highlight multiple cells and right click for even more options.  Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V are supported to easily copy and paste multiple cells.</p>
                 <p class="szt">Alternatively, export to a CSV file for further analysis and then import changes back into Security Zen.</p>
		 <p class="szt">Once you are happy with your changes, go back to SF Actions and select Deploy. Changes will be deployed to whatever is the current Connection. This gives you the flexibility to deploy your changes to the environment you retrieved security from or change connections and deploy to another environment.</p>
