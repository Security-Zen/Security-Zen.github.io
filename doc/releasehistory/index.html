            <li class="szt">Bug fix for retrieving all permissions of a Permission Set.  When Options Window "Permission Set Entities Retrieved" was set to "As Specified", and Configure Security Window had "Only Show Selections" checkbox checked when closing the Configure Security Window, and Permission Sets were selected, all security was retrieved for Permission Sets instead of retrieving only specified security.</li>
           </ul>

                <li class="szt">Automatic column width now driven by column headers instead of column content making automatic column sizing improved for large grids</li>

            <ul class="szm0">
               <li class="szt">Support for Muting Permission Sets.  Full disclosure, we are generally not a fan of muting permission sets because it breaks the "additive" security model previously used and will make debugging security more difficult.  We recommend avoiding Muting Permission Sets except in very specific circumstances such as removing permissions from a managed package Permission Set.</li>

           <p class="szt">Version 3.1 is a major overhaul of the code.  We request you provide feedback of your experience using this new version.</p>
           <p></p>
           <p class="szh2 szm0">2.9: 11/10/2019</p>

           <ul class="szm0">
            <li class="szt">Bug Fix: Corrects issue introduced with change in Salesforce API version during 2.7 release.</li>
           </ul>
           <p></p>
           <p class="szh2 szm0">2.7: 9/1/2019</p>
           <ul class="szm0">
            <li class="szt">Added "SF Actions->Security Assignment Analysis" function</li>
            <li class="szt">Added "Workspace Actions->Remove Entities From Workspace Not In Connection" function</li>
            <li class="szt">Added "Workspace Actions->Add Missing Objects To Workspace From Connection" function</li>

           <p class="szt"><b>Configure:</b></p>
           <ul class="szm0">
            <li class="szt">Renamed "Configure->Import" to "Configure->Import Package File"</li>
            <li class="szt">Renamed "Configure->Export" to "Configure->Export Package File"</li>
            <li class="szt">Bug Fix: Import of a Package file is now additive instead of mimicking mouse clicks.  This change applies when Objects and either Fields, or Record Types, of that Object are both specified within a file.  Previously, each entry in the package file executed a mouse click of that entity in the Configure->Select tree which could lead to unexpected results depending on the order the entities are listed in the package file.  For example, previously, specifying the object first and then a custom field of that object would first select the object (which automatically selected the child fields) and then the custom field entry would de-select that custom field in the tree.  This behavior was not intuitive and has been changed with this release.  The new behavior in this release is additive, so if Objects and Fields (or Record Types) of that Object are both listed in the package file, all entities are selected in the tree no matter what order they are specified in the file.</li>
            <li class="szt">Added ability to retrieve Objects Security without Field Level or Record Type Security</li>
            <li class="szt">Separated out tab retrieval of Standard Objects from the Object selection</li>

           <ul class="szm0">
            <li class="szt">Renamed "Workspace Actions->Import" to "Workspace Actions->Import CSV File"</li>
            <li class="szt">Renamed "Workspace Actions->Export" to "Workspace Actions->Export CSV File"</li>
            <li class="szt">Bug Fix: Workspace Actions->Import CSV File now imports rows from CSV files that have all empty cells.  Previously, rows with all empty cells were skipped during the import process</li>
            <li class="szt">Bug Fix: Workspace Actions->Import CSV File now ignores empty columns at the end of csv files.</li>
            <li class="szt">Bug Fix: Workspace Actions->Import CSV File now trims white space of cell values which caused errors during import.</li>
            <li class="szt">Improved error notification when importing CSV files to more clearly identify cells that have invalid values.</li>
            <li class="szt">Added "Highlight Environ Diff" function to more easily identify security differences between environments</li>
            <li class="szt">Bug Fix: Repaired "Reset Values" functionality</li>
            <li class="szt">Added "Workspace Actions->Import Metadata".  This enables import of metadata from ANT security files.</li>
