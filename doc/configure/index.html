		    <p class="szt">A list of Entity Types is presented based on the API version and the environment you have connected to.  If you do not see an Entity Type you are expecting, try modifying the "ANT Package API Version" in Options to a higher API version and then re-connecting.</p>
		    <p class="szt">Select on an Entity Type to retrieve a list of entities of that Entity Type.  Entities will be added to the tree under the selected Entity Type.

Exact requirements for successful deployments depend on the variances between the source and the destination environments.</p>
