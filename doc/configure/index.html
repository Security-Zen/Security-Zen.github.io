No limit on Security Files for Security Zen Masters.<br/></p>

		    <p class="szh2">Select By Workspace</p>
                    <p class="szt">The tree of Security Files and Entities is cleared out and then populated each time you connect to an environment.  If you want to compare two environments, this means making the same Configure selections twice.</p>
		    <p class="szt">The "Select By Workspace" button selects Security Files and Entities to retrieve based on what is currently in the workspace, so you don't have to make the same selections twice.</br>* "Select By Workspace" feature is only available to Security Zen Masters.</p>
                    <p></p>
		    <p class="szh2">Select By User...</p>
                    <p class="szt">The "Select By User" button enables you to select security files (a Profile and Permission Sets) by selecting a user.<br/>* "Select By User" feature is only available for Security Zen Masters.</p>
                    <p></p>
		    <p class="szh2">Select User</p>
                    <p class="szt">Enter a user's name (or part of a user's name) and "Enter" to retrieve a list of user's.  A maximum of 30 users will be returned.  Selecting a particular user from the list will select that user's corresponding Profile and Permission Sets in the Security Files tree.</p>
		    <p class="szt">If a filter is applied, the user's Profile and Permission Sets will be selected, however, depending on the filter criteria you might not see the selection until the filter is removed.</p>
		    <p class="szt">If Security Files have already been selected in the Security Files tree, you will be prompted to either clear out or add to the existing selections.</p>

		    <p class="szh2">Nickname</p>
                    <p class="szt">Providing a Nickname helps identify where security files are retrieved from.  Also, if you want to save this login information, the nickname is required.</p>
                    <p></p>
		    <p class="szh2">Color</p>
                    <p class="szt">You may optionally select a color to be associated with this connection.  Within the workspace, column headers will be displayed with the selected color.  This is particularly useful when comparing security settings from different connections.</p>
                    <p></p>
		    <p class="szh2">Security Lists</p>
                    <p class="szt">Normally, Security Zen retrieves a list of entities and security files upon connection to an environment.  If you are using Security Zen to just create an ANT package or View Deploy Details, you can connect faster by skipping the retrieval of these entities and security files (i.e. uncheck this checkbox).  Default is checked, so lists of entities and security files are retrieved upon connecting.</p>
                    <p></p>
		    <p class="szh2">Save</p>
                    <p class="szt">Selecting the Save checkbox will save the connection information for easy access later on.</p>
		    <p class="szt"><b>WARNING:</b> Usernames and passwords will be stored unencrypted on your machine.  Do NOT save a connection if using Security Zen on a shared computer or if there is a risk that this information could be accessed.</p>
                    <p></p>
		    <p class="szh2">Connect</p>
		    <p class="szt">Select the <b>Connect</b> button to establish a connection.  This will populate the available selections within Configure for this particular environment.</p>

		    <p class="szt">Within Salesforce, go to Setup->Apps->App Manager.  Select "New Connect App" button and fill in the following:</p>

		    <p class="szt">Copy the Consumer Key from the Connected App you just configured within Salesforce.</p>
		    <p></p>
		    <p class="szt">Within Security Zen, create a connection using the OAuth option and paste the Consumer Key.  When connecting using the OAuth option, a browser window will be launched prompting you to enter your Salesforce username and password for the OAuth Login.</p>
