		 <p class="szt">Below is a quick introduction to the Security Zen top level menu items and what they do.  Select buttons below for additional details.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Connections</p>
                 <p class="szt">Connections enable you to connect to your Salesforce environments such as Sandboxes and Production.  Establishing a connection is the first step to analyzing security.</p>
                 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Configure</p>
                 <p class="szt">Once a connection is established, select Configure->Configure Security to choose which security files (Profiles and/or Permission Sets) and which entities (Objects, Fields, Record Types, etc) you want to retrieve.  You must select at least one security file and at least one entity in order to retrieve security.</p>
                 <p class="szt">You can also create ANT package files using Configure->Create ANT Package File.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">SF Actions</p>
                 <p class="szt">Once you have made selections within Configure, select SF Actions->Retrieve to get the security settings from the Connection.  Watch the grid populate and get a whole new view of your security!</p>
                 <p class="szt">You can also deploy to other environments using SF Actions->Deploy, view details of previous deployments using SF Actions->View Deploy Details or analyze how security is assigned to users using SF Actions->Security Assignment Analysis.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p class="szh2">Workspace Actions</p>
                 <p class="szt">This is where the fun really starts!</p>
                 <p class="szt">You can sort, show/hide and much more to help you make sense of it all.  You can make changes directly in the workspace or highlight multiple cells and right click for even more options.  Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V are supported to easily copy and paste multiple cells.</p>
                 <p class="szt">Alternatively, export to a CSV file for further analysis and then import changes back into Security Zen.</p>
		 <p class="szt">Once you are happy with your changes, go back to SF Actions and select Deploy. Changes will be deployed to whatever is the current Connection. This gives you the flexibility to deploy your changes to the environment you retrieved security from or change connections and deploy to another environment.</p>
