		       <p class="szt">We are Salesforce Administrators, Developers, and Business Analysts like yourself.</p>
                       <p class="szt">We created Security Zen after many long hours  of clicking boxes for complex security deployments.  We thought, there  has to be a better way!  After much searching, we couldn't find anything  that let us do the security comparisons and deployments that we wanted  in an easy-to-view format that anyone could use.</p>
                       <p class="szt">So, we decided to build the tool we really wanted and named it for the peace and serenity it has given us: Security Zen!</p>

                 <p class="szt">If you follow our twitter feed, you will notice that we advocate for social justice.  We believe in the ideals that America was founded on such as equality, opportunity, and freedom.</p>
                 <p></p>
                 <p class="szt">Unfortunately, America is not living up to it's ideals.  We recognize that not everyone agrees with the viewpoints we promote - that's okay.  We believe everyone has the right to express their views.  Where we draw the line is when people impose their views on others.</p>
                 <p></p>
                 <p class="szt">Some of the causes we believe in:</p>
		 <ul>
		    <li class="szt">Equal rights, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, or sexual preference - you be you, and I'll be me.</li>
		    <li class="szt">Separation of church and state - pray however you want, but if you are in a role or place supported by everyone's tax dollars, you don't have the right to push your religion on others. If you serve the public, you must serve everyone equally, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, or sexual preference.</li>
	            <li class="szt">Abortion rights - one’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.</li>
		    <li class="szt">Increased gun regulation - the second ammendment starts with "A well <b>regulated</b> Militia,...".  Let's get reasonable people.</li>
		 </ul>
